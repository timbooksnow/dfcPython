# dfcPython

This is a forensics script launcher. 

Built with Tkinter in Python, dfcPython is a GUI which ties to different scripts and launches them as desired by the user.

The initial project was built as a fork on https://github.com/MikeO7/Hasher

Run the dfcPython.py file with Python to start the scriptlauncher.
